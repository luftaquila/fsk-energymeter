### Wiring

![](.github/assets/wire.png)

The _data cable_ and the _drive cable_ are two distinct cables. When driving the vehicle, connect the _drive cable_ to the LV connector of the device. To extract data, disconnect the _drive cable_ and connect the _data cable_ instead.

> [!CAUTION]
> Misconnection of the pins may cause permanent damage to the device.

> [!TIP]
> The easiest way to make a data cable is to cut a USB cable with Type-A connector on one end.

## 3. Usage

### 3-1. Record data

When driving the vehicle, connect both _HV cable_ and _drive cable_ to the device. The _drive cable_ should supply `VIN >= 6V` to start recording.

Once the device is powered up, it performs a zero calibration of the HV voltage and current. After calibration, it continuously measures data every 10 ms.

The measured data is updated to the file every 100 ms. During the file update, next measurement may be delayed by up to 5 ms.

A new log file is created with each power cycle. Each log file corresponds to a single power session.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the precise calibration, make sure that the HV voltage and current are at 0V and 0A until the startup is complete (typically 550 ms).

> [!NOTE]
> The device has an internal clock that tracks real-world time.
> Since the clock drifts over time, synchronize it with the FSK-EEM Viewer after a long period of non-use.
> If the time keeps resetting to `May 12, 2099`, the battery should be replaced.

### 3-2. Extract data

To extract the recorded data from the device, disconnect _drive cable_ and connect _data cable_ instead. There is no need to disconnect the _HV cable_ during data extraction.

Plug the USB side of the _data cable_ to the PC or smartphone (with a Type-A to C adapter). The FSK-EEM USB Mass Storage will appear [shortly](https://github.com/luftaquila/fsk-energymeter?tab=readme-ov-file#6-troubleshootings).

The log files are stored in the drive like a common USB memory. Copy the files to your PC.

> [!NOTE]
> The drive is ***read-only***; you cannot edit or delete the stored logs with the file explorer.

### 3-3. View data

Go to the [online viewer](https://fsk-energymeter.luftaquila.io) and open the log file to view a graph of the recorded data, or export it in a human-readable JSON/CSV format.

> [!TIP]
> If there is no Internet connection, download html or executable from the [release](https://github.com/luftaquila/fsk-energymeter/releases/latest) in advance.

### 3-4. Configure the device

In the viewer's Device Configuration section, click `Connect` and select the device to connect.

The device's UID and the current time will be displayed on successful connection.

* `Sync RTC`: Synchronizes the device clock with the host computer.
* `Delete`: Erases ***ALL*** files stored in the device.

Unplug and reconnect the device to see the change after deletion.

> [!WARNING]
> The delete action ***cannot be undone***.

## 6. Troubleshootings

#### 1. FSK-EEM USB Mass Storage takes too long to be mounted
The device only supports USB Full Speed (USB 1.1) spec. It is decades-old technology with a maximum transfer speed of 12 Mbps. However, in the real world, the actual speed is around 4 Mbps (0.5 MB/s).

When the device is connected to the host PC, the host will try to load the FAT table of the SDMMC. The FAT32 FAT table is typically a few megabytes, so it will take ~20 seconds to mount.

To reduce the mount time, format SD cards with larger cluster sizes. The RTC sync or record delete functions will work immediately regardless of this limit.

#### 2. `Web Serial API not supported` error on the FSK-EEM Viewer.

The FSK-EEM Viewer's Device Configuration tab uses the Web Serial API to talk with the device, which has [limited support](https://caniuse.com/?search=Web%20Serial%20API) across the platforms and browsers.

On macOS, the native app uses the Safari for its WebView, which does not supports the API. The web version (URL or html file) of the FSK-EEM Viewer will work on the Chromium. The mobile platforms also does not supports the API.
