| Pinout | 1: `D-`<br>2: `D+`<br>3: `5VOUT`<sup>1</sup><br>4: `VIN`<br>5: `GND` | 1: `HV+`<br>2: `HV-` |

<sup>1</sup> `5VOUT` is not used by the device. It outputs 5V and can drive current up to 800mA.

### Wiring

> [!CAUTION]
> Misconnection of the pins may cause permanent damage to the device.

> [!WARNING]
> When powered by USB, 5V rail of the USB must be connected to `VIN`, not `5VOUT`.

## DIY

### Hardware

[device/hardware/jlcpcb/production_files/](https://github.com/luftaquila/fsk-energymeter/tree/main/device/hardware/jlcpcb/production_files) directory includes gerber, BOM and CPL files for the JLCPCB PCBA(SMT) order.

> [!TIP]
> Exclude through-hole components(HV and LV connector, debug pin header and `L01Z600S05` Hall sensor) from the SMT assembly list. Purchase these parts from the global suppliers and solder it yourself to purchase them cheaper and reduce the setup fee.

### Firmware

Download the latest `fsk-energymeter-firmware-<version>.zip` from the [Release](https://github.com/luftaquila/fsk-energymeter/releases) and upload the `firmware-release.elf` to the device via ST-Link.

You may use [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) or [OpenOCD for Windows](https://gnutoolchains.com/arm-eabi/openocd/) to upload an ELF file.

Take a look at the OpenOCD script [device/firmware/fsk-energymeter.cfg](https://github.com/luftaquila/fsk-energymeter/blob/main/device/firmware/fsk-energymeter.cfg) if you are using OpenOCD.
