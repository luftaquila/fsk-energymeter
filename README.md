<sup>1</sup> `5VOUT` is not used by the device. It outputs 5V and can drive current up to 800mA.

### Wiring

> [!CAUTION]
> Misconnection of the pins may cause permanent damage to the device.

> [!WARNING]
> When powered by USB, 5V rail of the USB must be connected to `VIN`, not `5VOUT`.

## Usage

TODO

## DIY

### Hardware

[device/hardware/jlcpcb/production_files/](https://github.com/luftaquila/fsk-energymeter/tree/main/device/hardware/jlcpcb/production_files) directory includes gerber, BOM and CPL files for the JLCPCB PCBA(SMT) order.

> [!TIP]
> Exclude through-hole components (HV and LV connector, debug pin header and `L01Z600S05` Hall sensor) from the SMT assembly list. Purchase these parts from the global suppliers and solder it yourself to purchase them cheaper and reduce the setup fee.

### Firmware

Download the latest `fsk-energymeter-firmware-<version>.zip` from the [Release](https://github.com/luftaquila/fsk-energymeter/releases) and upload the `firmware-release.elf` to the device via ST-Link.

You may use [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) or [OpenOCD for Windows](https://gnutoolchains.com/arm-eabi/openocd/) to upload an ELF file.

Take a look at the OpenOCD script [device/firmware/fsk-energymeter.cfg](https://github.com/luftaquila/fsk-energymeter/blob/main/device/firmware/fsk-energymeter.cfg) if you are using OpenOCD.

## Development

    ```sh
    brew install make openocd
    ```
* Linux
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install build-essential openocd
    ```

2. Clone repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/luftaquila/fsk-energymeter.git --recursive
    ```

#### Build and upload

```sh
cd fsk-energymeter/device/firmware
make program  # release build
make debug    # debug build
```

### Viewer

#### Prerequisites

    npm run tauri dev    # run
    npm run tauri build  # build executables
    ```

## Troubleshootings

#### 1. FSK-EEM USB Mass Storage took too much time to be mounted on the PC
FSK-EEM uses the STM32F401, which implements a USB Full Speed PHY. It is decades-old technology with a maximum transfer speed of 12 Mbit/s. However, in the real world, the actual speed is around 4 Mbit/s or 0.5 MB/s. When you plug the FSK-EEM to your PC, the host(PC) will try to load the FAT table of the SD Card into its memory. Since the FAT32's FAT table is around 8 MB in size, it will take ~20 seconds for the FSK-EEM to be successfully mounted on the host computer. This is a hardware limitation in exchange of the lower cost. The RTC sync or record delete functions will work immediately regardless of this limit.
